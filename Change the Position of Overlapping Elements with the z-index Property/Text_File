When elements are positioned to overlap, the element coming later in the HTML markup will, by default, 
appear on the top of the other elements. However, the z-index property can specify the order of how elements are stacked on 
top of one another. It must be an integer (i.e. a whole number and not a decimal), 
and higher values for the z-index property of an element move it higher in the stack than those with lower values.


Add a z-index property to the element with the class name of first (the red rectangle) and set it to a value of 2 so it covers 
the other element (blue rectangle).
