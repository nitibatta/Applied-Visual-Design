The next layout scheme that CSS offers is the fixed position, 
which is a type of absolute positioning that locks an element relative to the browser window. 
Similar to absolute positioning, it's used with the CSS offset properties and also removes the 
element from the normal flow of the document. Other items no longer "realize" where it is positioned, 
which may require some layout adjustments elsewhere.

One key difference from the absolute position is that the element won't move when the user scrolls.


The navigation bar in the code is labeled with an id of navbar. 
Change its position to fixed, and offset it 0 pixels from the top and 0 pixels from the left. 
Notice the (lack of) impact to the h1 position, it hasn't been pushed down to accommodate 
the navigation bar and would need to be adjusted separately.
