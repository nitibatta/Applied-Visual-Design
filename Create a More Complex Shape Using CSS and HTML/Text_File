One of the most popular shapes in the world is the heart shape, and this challenge creates it with raw CSS. 
But first, you need to understand the :before and :after selectors. 
These selectors are used to add something before or after a selected element. 
In the following example, a :before selector is used to add a rectangle to an element with the class heart:

.heart:before {
  content: "";
  background-color: yellow;
  border-radius: 25%;
  position: absolute;
  height: 50px;
  width: 70px;
  top: -50px;
  left: 5px;
}

For the :before and :after selectors to function properly, they must have a defined content property. 
It usually has content such as a photo or text. 
When the :before and :after selectors add shapes, the content property is still required, 
but it's set to an empty string.

In the above example, the element with the class of heart has a :before selector that produces a yellow 
rectangle with height and width of 50px and 70px, respectively. 
This rectangle has round corners due to its 25% border 
radius and is positioned absolutely at 5px from the left and 50px above the top of the element.

Transform the element on the screen to a heart. 
In the heart:after selector, change the background-color to pink and the border-radius to 50%.

Next, target the element with the class heart (just heart) and fill in the transform property. 
Use the rotate() function with -45 degrees. (rotate() works the same way that skewX() and skewY() do).

Finally, in the heart:before selector, set its content property to an empty string.
