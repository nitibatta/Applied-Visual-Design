This challenge will touch on the usage of pseudo-classes. A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectors, 
in order to select a specific state of the element.

For example, the styling of an anchor tag can be changed for its hover state using the :hover pseudo-class selector. 
Here's the CSS to change the color of the anchor tag to red during its hover state:

a:hover {
  color: red;
}
The code editor has a CSS rule to style all a tags black. 
Add a rule so that when the user hovers over the a tag, the color is blue.

Definition and Usage:

The :hover selector is used to select elements when you mouse over them.

Tip: The :hover selector can be used on all elements, not only on links.

Tip: Use the :link selector to style links to unvisited pages, the :visited selector to style links to visited pages, and the :active selector to style the active link.

Note: :hover MUST come after :link and :visited (if they are present) in the CSS definition, in order to be effective!
