In the previous challenge, you changed the animation rates for two similarly animated elements by altering 
their @keyframes rules. You can achieve the same goal by 
manipulating the animation-duration of multiple elements.

In the animation running in the code editor, there are three "stars" in the sky 
that twinkle at the same rate on a continuous loop. To make them twinkle at different rates, 
you can set the animation-duration property to different values 
for each element.

Set the animation-duration of the elements with the classes star-1, star-2, and star-3 to 1s, 0.9s, and 1.1s, respectively.
