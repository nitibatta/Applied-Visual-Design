To underline text, you can use the u tag. This is often used to signify that a section of text is important, 
or something to remember. With the u tag, the browser applies the CSS of text-decoration: underline; to the element.


Wrap the u tag around the text "Ph.D. students". It should not include the parent div that has the class of cardText.

Note:
Try to avoid using the u tag when it could be confused for a link. Anchor tags also have a default underlined formatting.
