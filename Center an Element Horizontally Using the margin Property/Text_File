Another positioning technique is to center a block element horizontally. 
One way to do this is to set its margin to a value of auto.

This method works for images, too. Images are inline elements by default, but can be changed to block elements when you 
set the display property to block.


Center the div on the page by adding a margin property with a value of auto.
By setting the margin to auto it moves to the center.
