You can specify the width of an element using the width property in CSS. 
Values can be given in relative length units (such as em), absolute length units (such as px), 
or as a percentage of its containing parent element. Here's an example that changes the width of an image to 220px:

img {
width: 220px;
}

Add a width property to the entire card and set it to an absolute value of 245px. 
Use the fullCard class to select the element.
