There are a variety of ways to alter the animation rates of similarly animated elements. 
So far, this has been achieved by applying an animation-iteration-count property and setting @keyframes rules.

To illustrate, the animation on the right consists of two "stars" that each decrease in size and opacity at the 
20% mark in the @keyframes rule, which creates the twinkle animation. 
You can change the @keyframes rule for one of the elements so the stars twinkle at different rates.

Alter the animation rate for the element with the class name of star-1 by changing its @keyframes rule to 50%.
