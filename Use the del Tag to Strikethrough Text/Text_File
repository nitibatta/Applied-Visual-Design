To strikethrough text, which is when a horizontal line cuts across the characters, 
you can use the del tag. It shows that a section of text is no longer valid. With the del tag, 
the browser applies the CSS of text-decoration: line-through; to the element.


Wrap the del tag around "Google" inside the h4 tag and then add the word Alphabet beside it, 
which should not have the strikethrough formatting.
